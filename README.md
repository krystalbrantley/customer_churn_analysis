# **Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI**

## Description
This project involved analyzing customer churn to understand why customers were leaving and creating a comprehensive report using Power BI. The analysis aimed to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and provide actionable insights to reduce future attrition.

## Objectives
- Identify patterns and trends associated with customer churn.
- Determine key factors influencing customer attrition.
- Develop visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- Provide recommendations to reduce churn based on the analysis. 

## Data Source
The analysis was conducted using a dataset for a fictitious telecommunications company called Databel. The dataset contains customer information and churn status. The dataset included various attributes such as customer demographics, service usage, and account details.

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI: For data visualization and report creation.
- Power Query editor: For data preprocessing and transformation.
- Data Source File: `Databel - Data.csv`

## Overarching Insights

![Customer Churn Analysis Overview](https://github.com/krystalbrantley/customer_churn_analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Overview.png?raw=true)
- **Churn rate:** The churn rate for Databel is ~27%.
- **Top reasons why customers churn:**
  - Competitors made a better offer
  - Competitors had better devices
  - Attitude of support person
- ~45% of the reasons why customers churn are related to competitors, raising the question: Is Databel competitive enough?
- **Churn rate by state:** The churn rate in California is abnormally high with more than 60% of customers leaving.

## Data Exploration and Analysis

### Analyze and Visualize Data
#### Analyzing Demographics
- **Churn rate by age:** The churn rate increases with age. Senior citizens (age 65 and over) have a churn rate of 38.46%, significantly above the average.
- **Individual vs. Group Plans:** The churn rate for individual plans is significantly higher at 32.85% compared to people in a group of 2 or more. The average monthly charge for group plans is lower (about $23) compared to individual plans ($33.50).
- **Monthly vs. Yearly Contracts:** Monthly contracts have a higher churn rate compared to yearly contracts.

#### Impact of Unlimited Data Plan
- **Hypothesis:** People who are not on an unlimited data plan are more likely to churn.
- The churn rate is 32.11% for those with unlimited data plans compared to 16.10% for those without unlimited data.
- Customers who consume 10 or more gigabytes and are not on an unlimited data plan pay $31.19 on average, incurring extra costs for additional data usage.

#### International Calls
- 91% of people without an international plan could be potential clients for a new promotion.
- The churn rate for customers who pay for an international plan but donâ€™t call internationally is extremely high.

### Investigate Churn Rate by State
- California has an abnormally high churn rate with more than 60% of customers leaving.

### Investigate Reasons for Churn
- The top 3 reasons customers churn are:
  - Competitors made a better offer
  - Competitors had better devices
  - Attitude of support person
  
### Customer Service Calls
- Even though the use of customer service is higher for churners, California stands out with the highest churn rate and the lowest number of customer service calls.

## Recommended Next Actions
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended to reduce customer churn:

1. **Enhance Competitiveness:**
   - Review and improve pricing and service offerings to match or exceed competitors.
   - Invest in better devices and technology to attract and retain customers.

2. **Improve Customer Service:**
   - Address issues related to the attitude and effectiveness of support personnel.
   - Increase customer service outreach, especially in high-churn states like California.

3. **Promote Group Plans:**
   - Encourage customers to switch to group plans which have a lower churn rate and offer better value.

4. **Adjust Contract Types:**
   - Offer incentives for senior customers to switch from monthly to yearly contracts to reduce churn.

5. **Unlimited Data Plan Promotion:**
   - Promote unlimited data plans, especially to customers who consume high amounts of data to prevent extra charges that lead to churn.

6. **International Plan Promotion:**
   - Target customers without international plans with promotions or propose they downgrade their plan to increase satisfaction and reduce churn.
